INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

PREREQUISITES

You should have a working OMNeT++ installation, version 5.5.1 with INET (v.3.6.6), CoRE4INET, FiCo4OMNeT and SignalsAndGateways installed.

General
-------
1. Make sure your OMNeT++ installation works OK (e.g. try running the samples)
   and it is in the path (to test, try the command "which nedtool").

2. Extract the downloaded tarball into a directory of your choice (usually into your
   workspace directory, if you are using the IDE).

If you are building from command line:
--------------------------------------
3. Change to the SOQoSMW directory.

4. Type "make makefiles". This should generate the makefiles for you automatically.

5. Type "make" to build the SOQoSMW executable (debug version). Use "make MODE=release"
   to build release version.

6. you can run specific examples by changing into the example's directory.

If you are using the IDE:
-------------------------
3. Open the OMNeT++ IDE and choose the workspace where you have extracted the SOQoSMW directory.
   The extracted directory must be a subdirectory of the workspace dir.

4. Import the project using: File | Import | General | Existing projects into Workspace.
   Then select the workspace dir as the root directory, and be sure NOT to check the
   "Copy projects into workspace" box. Click Finish.

5. Wait until the indexer finishes. Now you can build the project by pressing CTRL-B (Project | Build all)

6. To run an example from the IDE open the example's directory in the Project Explorer view,
   find the corresponding omnetpp.ini file. Right click on it and select Run As / Simulation.
   This should create a Launch Configuration for this example.

Note:
-----
- by default SOQoSMW is creating a shared library (libSOQoSMW.so etc.)
  in the "src" directory. To use the shared library you can use the "opp_run"
  command to load it dynamically.
- If you add/remove files/directories later in the src directory, you MUST
  re-create your makefile. Run "make makefiles" again if you are building
  from the command line. (The IDE does it for you automatically)


Hit Ctrl+B to build.

Run the example simulations to check everything works fine.
