Evaluates the QoS middleware performance in a large network.

The network consists of 2 App nodes which send cross-traffic, a Publishing node with 10 published services, and 10 subscriber nodes with 10 subscriber services each.

Each subscriber node subscribes to all published services.

This example shows how the QoS Negotiation scales with a growing number of services.
