Demonstrates a small network which discovers services with the full SOME/IP SD.
After the service discovery publishers send messages to their subscribers.

- The small network contains the three hosts: node1, node2, node3

- Next to that there is one switch that connects every node with each other.
  So all hosts can communicate with each other over the switch.

- Currently the QoS groups are limited to SOMEIP_TCP and SOMEIP_UDP.
