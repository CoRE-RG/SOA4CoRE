Demonstrates a small network which discovers services with the full SOME/IP SD.
After the service discovery publishers send messages to their subscribers.

- The small network contains the three hosts: node1, node2, node3

- Next to that there is one switch that connects every node with each other.
  So all hosts can communicate with each other over the switch.

- Currently the QoS groups are limited to SOMEIP_TCP and SOMEIP_UDP.

- node 3 receives update from the service at node1 via udp and node 2 via tcp
	- in the UDP_only config both services receive UDP messages
	
	
	
IMPORTANT: If you want to run this example using dynamic IGMP Routing
		Apply the patch located in this repository under patches/inet-igmp-patch.diff
		This will add dynamic route learning for inet routers.
