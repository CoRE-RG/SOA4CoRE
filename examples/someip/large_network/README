Demonstrates a large SOME/IP Service Discovery network.
After the service discovery publishers send messages to their subscribers.

- The large network contains the eight hosts:
  HostWest, HostNorthWest, HostNorth, HostNorthEast,
  HostEast, HostSouthEast, HostSouth, HostSouthWest

- Next to that there are the three switches:
  SwitchWest, SwitchCenter, SwitchEast
  
- All hosts are connected with their according switch:
  -> Hosts on the west side are connected with SwitchWest
  -> Hosts on the east side are connected with SwitchEast
  -> HostNorth and HostSouth are connected with SwitchCenter
  
- SwitchCenter is connected with the switches SwitchWest and SwitchEast.
  So all hosts can communicate with each other over the switches.

- The publisher hosts are: HostWest, HostNorthWest, HostNorth, HostNorthEast
- On every publisher host there are five services with a unique service id.

- The subscriber hosts are: HostEast, HostSouthEast, HostSouth, HostSouthWest
- On every subscriber host there are seven subscribers. 

- The relation between the hosts are in the following manner:
  
  PublisherHost                               SubscriberHost
  -------------                               --------------
  HostWest      <---------------------------> HostEast
  HostNorthWest <---------------------------> HostSouthWest
  HostNorth     <---------------------------> HostSouth
  HostNorthEast <---------------------------> HostSouthEast
  
  So all subscribers on the subscriber hosts subscribe publisher services
  on the opposite publisher host.
  
- The subscribers on every host subscribe publisher services in this manner:

  Publisher service                           Subscriber
  -----------------                           ----------
  service1          <-----------------------> subscriber1
  service2          <-----------------------> subscriber2
  service3          <-----------------------> subscriber3
  service4          <-----------------------> subscriber4
  service5          <-----------------------> subscriber5
  service1          <-----------------------> subscriber6
  service5          <-----------------------> subscriber7
  
  So three subscribers subscribe three different publisher services.
  Each two of the other four subscribe the same publisher service.
