Demonstrates a small network which neogtiates QoS over the SOME/IP layer

- This small network consists of the hosts: N[0-3], and CT[0-1]

- three switches connect the hosts

- configurations are extended with multiple types of traffics (configs Z_[...]), which are then combined into the scenarios
	- SOMEIP_UDP_MCAST[_CT, _Q, _CT_Q, _Q_Sync]
	- SOMEIP_UDP[_CT, _Q, _CT_Q]
	- SOMEIP_TCP[_CT, _Q, _CT_Q]
	- SOMEIP_MIXED[_CT, _Q, _CT_Q]
	
- During SOME/IP discovery and subscription, deadlines and TSN 802.1Q options will be exchanged	
	
- The IP stack on the host will be configured to accomodate for the QoS and TSN prioritis

- After the service discovery and QoS reservation publishers send messages to their subscribers

- Cross traffic can be added to validate QoS behavior
